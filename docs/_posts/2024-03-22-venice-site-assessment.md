The Blueshores team has successfully completed the initial site assessment for the Venice Lagoon case study, marking a significant milestone in our micro-tidal research program.

## Assessment Overview

Our comprehensive site assessment included:

- Wave energy and vessel wake measurements
- Sediment composition analysis
- Baseline habitat surveys
- Navigation channel mapping
- Heritage site documentation

## Key Findings

The Venice Lagoon presents unique challenges due to its micro-tidal nature, historic urban waterfront setting, and the dominance of vessel wake as the primary wave driver. These findings will inform our intervention design approach.

## Proposed Interventions

Based on our assessment, we are developing a hybrid approach that includes:

- **Fascine breakwalls** - traditional wooden structures adapted for modern application
- **Oyster shell reef elements** - to promote biodiversity and wave dissipation
- **BESE® elements** - innovative biodegradable structures for habitat creation

The placement and configuration will be optimized to balance wave attenuation with navigation requirements and heritage preservation.

## Next Steps

- Detailed intervention design and modeling
- Stakeholder consultation with port authorities and heritage organizations
- Preparation for installation and monitoring phase
