The Blueshores team hosted a highly successful community engagement workshop in Cork, Ireland, bringing together local stakeholders, port operators, and environmental advocates to discuss sustainable port development and ecosystem restoration.

## Workshop Highlights

The full-day workshop attracted over 50 participants representing diverse perspectives:

- Cork Port Company representatives
- Local fishing communities
- Environmental NGOs
- Tourism operators
- Local government officials
- Academic researchers

## Key Discussion Themes

### Balancing Economic and Environmental Goals

Participants emphasized the importance of maintaining Cork Harbour's role as a major commercial port while enhancing its natural heritage value. The concept of "living shorelines" that support both functions resonated strongly with attendees.

### Renewable Energy Integration

There was considerable interest in integrating offshore renewable energy infrastructure with coastal protection and habitat restoration efforts, creating multiple benefits from single interventions.

### Community Benefits

Local stakeholders highlighted the importance of:

- Improved water quality for recreation and tourism
- Enhanced fisheries productivity
- Educational and research opportunities
- Climate change resilience

## Next Steps

Based on workshop feedback, we are refining our Cork Harbour intervention designs to ensure they address community priorities while meeting our research objectives. A follow-up workshop is planned for autumn 2024 to present detailed designs and gather additional input.

## Acknowledgments

We thank all participants for their valuable contributions and Cork Port Company for hosting the event. Special thanks to our community liaisons who helped organize and facilitate this successful engagement.
