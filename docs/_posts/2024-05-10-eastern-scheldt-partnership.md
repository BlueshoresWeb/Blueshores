We are pleased to announce a formal partnership agreement with the Eastern Scheldt Storm Surge Barrier Authority in the Netherlands, enabling collaborative research on retrofitting hard infrastructure with nature-based enhancements.

## Partnership Benefits

This collaboration provides:

- Access to the barrier infrastructure for research and monitoring
- Historical performance data and engineering specifications
- Expertise from Dutch coastal engineers and ecologists
- Integration with existing monitoring programs

## Eastern Scheldt Innovation

The Eastern Scheldt Storm Surge Barrier is one of the world's most impressive coastal engineering achievements. Our research will explore how to enhance this existing infrastructure with:

- Bio-engineered barrier enhancements
- Tidal energy integration
- Aquaculture zones
- Adaptive management protocols

## Research Goals

Our work at the Eastern Scheldt aims to:

1. Demonstrate that hard infrastructure can be successfully integrated with nature-based solutions
2. Develop methodologies for assessing multi-functional performance
3. Create replicable models for other barrier systems worldwide
4. Generate economic value through blue economy activities while enhancing ecological performance

## Timeline

Field work at the Eastern Scheldt will commence in summer 2024, with initial monitoring installations scheduled for early autumn.
