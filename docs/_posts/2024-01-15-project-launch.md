We are excited to announce the official launch of the Blueshores project - a groundbreaking initiative to develop hybrid multifunctional foreshore infrastructure that optimises environmental and blue economy benefits for working ports.

## Project Vision

The Blueshores project brings together leading experts in coastal engineering, marine ecology, and blue economy development to create innovative solutions that benefit both the environment and commercial port operations.

## Research Approach

Our research will focus on three key case study locations:

- **Venice Lagoon** - addressing micro-tidal environments with heritage constraints
- **Eastern Scheldt** - retrofitting existing storm surge barriers with nature-based enhancements
- **Cork Harbour** - balancing commercial port operations with environmental stewardship

## What's Next

Over the coming months, we will be:

- Establishing baseline monitoring systems at each case study site
- Engaging with local stakeholders and communities
- Developing intervention designs tailored to each location
- Building partnerships with port authorities and environmental agencies

Stay tuned for regular updates on our progress!
