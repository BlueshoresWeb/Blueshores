# Partners and Collaborators

The Blueshores project brings together leading institutions, research organizations, port authorities, and environmental agencies to develop innovative coastal solutions.

## Research Partners

### Academic Institutions

Our research is conducted in collaboration with world-class academic institutions providing expertise in coastal engineering, marine ecology, and blue economy development.

**Leading Universities and Research Centers:**
- Coastal Engineering Research Institutes
- Marine Biology Departments
- Environmental Science Faculties
- Blue Economy Research Centers

### Research Networks

We participate in and contribute to international research networks focused on coastal resilience, nature-based solutions, and sustainable port development.

## Port Authorities

### Eastern Scheldt Storm Surge Barrier Authority

**Location:** Netherlands  
**Partnership Focus:** Retrofitting hard infrastructure with nature-based enhancements, tidal energy integration, and aquaculture development

The Eastern Scheldt partnership provides access to one of the world's most advanced coastal protection systems, enabling research on integrating ecological functions with existing engineering infrastructure.

### Cork Port Company

**Location:** Ireland  
**Partnership Focus:** Green port infrastructure, living shorelines, and ecosystem restoration within active port operations

Cork Port Company is collaborating on sustainable port development that maintains commercial viability while enhancing environmental performance and community benefits.
