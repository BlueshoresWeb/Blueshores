title: Eastern Scheldt (macro-tidal)
permalink: /case-studies/eastern-scheldt
context: |
  Tide: macro • Slope: flat • Energy: high. Constraints: existing storm barrier infrastructure, marine ecology.
intervention: |
  Bio-engineered barrier enhancements + tidal energy integration + aquaculture zones. Adaptive management protocols.
monitoring: |
  Ecological sensors, energy output meters, aquaculture yield tracking, barrier performance analytics.
