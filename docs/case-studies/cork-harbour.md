# Cork Harbour Case Study

Cork Harbour, one of the world's largest natural harbours, provides an ideal setting for developing sustainable port infrastructure that balances economic development with environmental stewardship.

## Project Overview

Our Cork Harbour case study focuses on creating multifunctional foreshore infrastructure that supports:

- Commercial port operations and expansion
- Marine ecosystem restoration and protection
- Renewable energy development
- Sustainable aquaculture and fisheries

## Harbour Characteristics

- **Natural Deep Water**: Ideal for large vessel operations
- **Diverse Ecosystems**: Mudflats, saltmarshes, and marine habitats
- **Economic Importance**: Major Irish port for container and bulk cargo
- **Community Value**: Fishing, recreation, and coastal communities

## Development Opportunities

- **Green Port Infrastructure**: Sustainable terminal design and operations
- **Living Shorelines**: Natural coastal protection and habitat creation
- **Offshore Renewables**: Wind and wave energy integration
- **Blue Economy**: Aquaculture, tourism, and maritime services

## Environmental Integration

- Habitat restoration and creation
- Water quality improvement measures
- Carbon sequestration through blue carbon ecosystems
- Biodiversity enhancement programs

## Expected Outcomes

- Enhanced port competitiveness and sustainability
- Restored marine and coastal ecosystems
- Renewable energy contribution to national grid
- Strengthened coastal communities and blue economy
