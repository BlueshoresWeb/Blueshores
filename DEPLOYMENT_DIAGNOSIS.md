# Deployment Diagnosis and Resolution

## Current Status ✅

Based on analysis of recent workflow runs:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: ✅ WORKING (runs #56, #57 completed successfully)
- **Jekyll Build**: ✅ WORKING (builds complete without errors)
- **Deployment Step**: ✅ WORKING (artifacts created and deployed successfully)
- **Expected Site URL**: https://blueshoresweb.github.io/Blueshores/

## Diagnosing "Deploy Does Not Get Activated"

The deployment is technically working, but the site may not be accessible. Here's how to diagnose:

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Configuration

**⚠️ Repository Admin Required**

1. Go to [Repository Settings > Pages](https://github.com/BlueshoresWeb/Blueshores/settings/pages)
2. Verify **Source** is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. If it shows "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

### Step 2: Verify Site Accessibility

Try accessing the site from multiple sources:
- **Direct URL**: https://blueshoresweb.github.io/Blueshores/
- **Different networks** (mobile data, different WiFi)
- **Different browsers** (clear cache first)

### Step 3: Check Workflow Status

Visit the [Actions tab](https://github.com/BlueshoresWeb/Blueshores/actions) and verify:
- Latest "Deploy Jekyll site to GitHub Pages" workflow shows ✅ green checkmark
- Both "build" and "deploy" jobs completed successfully

### Step 4: DNS and Caching Issues

If the workflow succeeds but site isn't accessible:
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation
- **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Try incognito/private browsing mode**

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Manual GitHub Pages Setup

If you have repository admin access:
```
1. Settings > Pages
2. Source: GitHub Actions
3. Save
```

### Fix 2: Force Redeploy

Trigger a new deployment:
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger rebuild
echo "<!-- Redeploy: $(date) -->" >> docs/index.md
git add docs/index.md
git commit -m "Force redeploy"
git push
```

### Fix 3: Check Network Restrictions

Some networks block GitHub Pages. Test from:
- Mobile data
- Different WiFi network
- VPN if available

## Still Having Issues?

If none of the above work, please provide:

1. **Screenshot** of Settings > Pages configuration
2. **URL you're trying to access**
3. **Error message** you see (if any)
4. **Network you're on** (work/university networks often block GitHub Pages)

The technical deployment is working correctly - the issue is likely with access configuration or network restrictions.
