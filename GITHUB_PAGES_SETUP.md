# GitHub Pages Deployment Issue and Resolution

## Problem (RESOLVED)

The GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the Jekyll site to GitHub Pages was failing with the following error:

```
Get Pages site failed. Please verify that the repository has Pages enabled and configured to build using GitHub Actions, or consider exploring the `enablement` parameter for this action.
HttpError: Not Found
```

## Root Cause

The repository's GitHub Pages settings are not configured to use "GitHub Actions" as the deployment source. The workflow expects GitHub Pages to be set up to deploy from GitHub Actions, but it's likely configured to deploy from a branch (like `gh-pages`) or not enabled at all.

## Solution

A repository administrator needs to update the GitHub Pages configuration:

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to the [Blueshores repository](https://github.com/BlueshoresWeb/Blueshores)
   - Click on "Settings" tab (requires admin access)

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages"

3. **Set Source to GitHub Actions**
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" instead of "Deploy from a branch"
   - This enables the repository to use the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment

4. **Verify Configuration**
   - Once saved, the repository will be configured to deploy using the workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
   - The next push or manual workflow run should successfully deploy the site

### Expected Outcome

After configuration:
- The Jekyll site will be available at: `https://blueshoresweb.github.io/Blueshores/`
- Pushes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger deployment
- Pull requests will run the build job to verify the site builds correctly

## Technical Details

### Workflow Configuration

The current workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) is correctly configured with:

- **Proper permissions**: `contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`
- **Concurrency control**: Prevents multiple simultaneous deployments
- **Build process**: Builds Jekyll site from `/docs` directory with correct baseurl
- **Deployment**: Uses official GitHub Pages deployment actions

### Jekyll Configuration

The Jekyll site is properly configured in `/docs` with:

- **Base URL**: Set to `/Blueshores` to match repository name
- **Theme**: Using `minima` theme compatible with GitHub Pages
- **Plugins**: Only GitHub Pages compatible plugins
- **Content**: All pages use proper Jekyll front matter and relative URL filters

## Alternative: Manual Verification

If you want to test the site locally before deployment:

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Visit http://localhost:4000/Blueshores/ to preview
```
