## The Problem (RESOLVED)
GitHub Pages deployment was failing because the repository was not configured to use GitHub Actions for deployment.

## The Solution (Repository Admin Action Required)

1. Go to [Repository Settings > Pages](https://github.com/BlueshoresWeb/Blueshores/settings/pages)
2. Under "Source", change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the settings

## What This Will Fix

✅ **Immediate**: Website will be deployed to https://blueshoresweb.github.io/Blueshores/  
✅ **Automatic**: Future pushes to main branch will auto-deploy  
✅ **PR Testing**: Pull requests will build and test the site without deploying  

## What Was Changed in This PR

- 📖 Added detailed setup documentation (`GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md`)
- ⚠️ Added prominent notice in main `README.md`
- 🔧 Improved workflow to only deploy on main branch (not PRs)
- ✅ Verified Jekyll builds correctly with proper configuration

## Test Status

- ✅ Jekyll site builds successfully locally
- ✅ All pages and navigation links work correctly
- ✅ Baseurl configuration is correct for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Workflow syntax is valid and improved

**Once the repository admin completes the GitHub Pages configuration, the deployment should work immediately.**
