## Problem Summary (RESOLVED)

The Blueshores website was experiencing "missing colours" where the marine theme with blue gradients, wave animations, and styled navigation buttons was not showing on the live GitHub Pages site, despite working perfectly in local development.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **conflicting GitHub Actions workflows** for Jekyll deployment:

1. **Failing Workflow**: `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`
   - ❌ Used wrong source directory (`./` instead of `./docs`)
   - ❌ Failed with error: `File to import not found or unreadable: minima`
   - ❌ Used GitHub Pages default bundle instead of our custom configuration
   - ❌ This workflow was deploying (or failing to deploy) to the live site

2. **Working Workflow**: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
   - ✅ Correctly builds from `./docs` directory
   - ✅ Uses proper baseurl configuration
   - ✅ Includes all custom dependencies and marine theme styles
   - ✅ Successfully compiles SCSS with marine color palette

## Solution Applied

**Removed the conflicting workflow** (`.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`) to ensure only the working workflow handles deployments.

### Technical Details

The failing workflow had these issues:
```yaml
# Wrong source directory
source: ./          # Should be ./docs

# Used GitHub Pages default Jekyll which lacks our theme
uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
```

The working workflow correctly:
```yaml
# Builds from docs directory
working-directory: ./docs

# Uses our custom bundle with proper dependencies
bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"
```

## Marine Theme Features

The marine theme includes:
- **Header**: Blue gradient background (#003d5c → #0077be → #4da6d9)
- **Navigation**: White text with blue hover effects
- **Wave Animation**: Animated SVG waves with multiple layers
- **Buttons**: Styled navigation buttons with blue gradients and hover effects
- **Footer**: Dark blue gradient footer
- **Typography**: Ocean blue headings with gradient underlines

## Verification

- ✅ Local development shows full marine theme
- ✅ Jekyll build completes successfully
- ✅ CSS compilation includes all marine theme styles
- ✅ Only working deployment workflow remains

## Expected Outcome

Once this PR is merged to main branch:
1. The working workflow will deploy the site with proper marine theme
2. Live site at `https://blueshoresweb.github.io/Blueshores/` will show all colors
3. No more deployment conflicts or failures

## Files Modified

- **Removed**: `.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml` (conflicting workflow)
- **Kept**: `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (working workflow)
- **Preserved**: All marine theme styles in `docs/assets/main.scss`
